PROJECT MANAGER
This was my final project to Flag Front-End Development Course.
The objective of this project was to use tools that were taught along the course, such as HTML, CSS, JS, and Angular. The methods and frameworks chosen for the execution of the project were Angular, Bootstrap, Sass and HTML.
The project theme was chosen by me and I decided to make a Project Manager app inspired by Trello. I worked with columns, lists, sorting types, modals, forms, authentication services, routing, communication between components... I also did all the style, responsive design, organization, and presentation of the app.

# FinalProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
